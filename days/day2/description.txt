Part One

You play several games and record the information from each game (your
puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in
Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of
cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put
back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second
set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is
only 2 green cubes.

only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.


Part Two


    In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.
    Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.
    Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.
    Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.
    Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.


The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and
blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes
in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36,
respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.
