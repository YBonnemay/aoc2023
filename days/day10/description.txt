# Part one

In this example, the farthest point from the start is 4 steps away.

Here's the more complex loop again:

..F7.
.FJ|.
SJ.L7
|F--J
LJ...

Here are the distances for each tile on that loop:

..45.
.236.
01.78
14567
23...

Find the single giant loop starting at S. How many steps along the
loop does it take to get from the starting position to the point
farthest from the starting position?
